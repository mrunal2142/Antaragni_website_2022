              choice of the options.<br />
              4. After a goal has been scored, the game is restarted in exactly
              the same manner with the kickoff being taken by a player of the

                Rules:
              </h4>

              The Field of Play<br />
              The Field must be rectangular in shape and distinctly marked by
              two short goal lines and two long-touch lines. The field is
              divided into halves, separated by the halfway line, which runs
              from the midpoints of each t touchline. At the midpoint of the
              halfway line is a marked center point surrounded by a lined center
              circle with a radius of 10 yards. Opposition players are not
              allowed to enter this circle during the possessing team’s
              kick-off. The length of the touchline must be greater than the
              length of the goal line.

              <br /><br />

              Regulation lengths are:<br />
              1. Touchline: Minimum 90 meters (100 yards), m maximum 120 meters
              (130 yards)<br />
              2. Width (goal line): Minimum 45 m (50 yds), maximum 90 m (100
              yards).<br />
              3. At each end of the field is an eight-yard-wide goal-centered
              along the goal line.<br />
              4. Six yards from each goal post along the goal line and six yards
              out into the field (perpendicular to the goal l line) is the goal
              box.<br />
              5. Extending 18 yards from each goal post along the goal line and
              1 8 yards out into the field (perpendicular to the goal line) is
              the penalty box.<br />
              6. In each of the four corners of the field is a five-foot-high
              corner lag.
              <br /><br />
              The Number of Players-<br />
              Matches are generally played by two teams of 11 to each side. The
              goalkeeper is included in the 1 1-player t total. If a team cannot
              field, at least seven players at match time, the game is a
              forfeit. Teams of fewer than 11 a side can often be seen in youth
              leagues where smaller teams are used as a developmental tool.
              <br /><br />
              The Referees-<br />
              The referee is the authority on the fields, and his word is the
              law. If you question a referee’s decision, you can be disciplined
              further simply for dissent.
              <br /><br />
              The Assistant Referees-<br />
              The assistant referees are p primarily r responsible for assisting
              the r referee in performing his duties – this includes s signaling
              with a lag when a ball goes of play, when a player is fouled, or
              when a player is in an offside position.
              <br /><br />
              The Duration of the match: -<br />
              A soccer match is comprised of two 4 5-minute halves, with e extra
              time added for each at the referee’s d discretion. The halves are
              separated by a half-time period not to exceed 15 minutes (90)
              Minutes.

              <br /><br />
              Fouls and Misconduct<br />
              • A direct free kick is awarded when a player<br />
              • Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent<br />

              <br /><br />
              If any of these are e fouls are committed by a player in their

            1. Players and Equipment:<br />
            • Each team will consist of 8-10 players. Teams must have a minimum
            of 6 players present at game time to begin.<br />
            • Players may not wear baseball-style caps or other rigid
            headwear.<br />
            • Knit and stocking caps are permitted. Players may wear a headband
            no wider than two inches and made of non-abrasive cloth, elastic,
            fiber, soft leather, or rubber.<br />
            • Bandanas and other headgear with knots are prohibited.<br />
            • Rubber or cloth elastic bands may be used to control hair.<br />
            • No jewelry or any other item deemed dangerous by the Intramural
            Staff may be worn. Any player wearing exposed permanent jewelry
            (e.g., body piercings) will not be permitted to play.
            <br /><br />
            2. Game Factors and Timing:<br />
            • Each match will consist of a best two-of-three game series. Each
            game within the match will have a time limit of eight minutes.<br />
            • If all the player from a team gets eliminated before eight minutes
            all the eliminated team players can enter the court again.<br />
            • If neither team has been completely eliminated when the time
            expires, the team with the greater number of points will be declared
            the winner.<br />
            • If an equal number of points remain when the time expires, teams
            will get extra time of three minutes each half of ninety seconds.<br /><br />

            3. Start of Play:<br />
            • Each game will begin with players of each team positioned behind
            their respective end lines.<br />
            • 2 dodgeballs are placed along the centerline.<br />
            • After being signaled to do so by the Intramural Sports Manager,
            any two players from each team may approach the centerline during
            the opening rush to retrieve the balls.<br />
            • Teams retrieve both the balls as possible.<br />
            • Players may not cross the center court line during this process;
            if they do cross, they will be declared out.<br />
            • Each ball retrieved at the opening rush must first be taken behind
            the attack line before it may be legally<br />
            thrown at an opponent.<br />
            • A player who is hit with a ball that has not been taken behind the
            attack line will not be declared out.<br />
            • Attack line restrictions end when all balls have been taken behind
            the attack line. <br />
            • For the remainder of the game, balls can be thrown at opponents
            from anywhere on the court without crossing the center box line.<br /><br />

            4. Rules of Play:<br />
            • The playing area will be marked with the center, side, end, and
            attack lines.<br />
            • During play, all players must remain within the boundary lines.<br />
            • Players may step on the boundary lines; however, if he or she
            crosses any boundary line, then he or she will be declared out.<br />
            • Players may only leave their boundary lines by passing through
            their own end line to chase out-of-bounds balls.<br />
            • 2-4 players should be allotted out of the box to retrieve the
            ball.<br />
            • Any player inside the box will not be allowed to have any part of
            his or her body contact an out of boundary area, in any of these
            instances the player will be declared out.<br />
            • An out is determined by an opposing player with a live thrown ball
            at or below the shoulders, causing an opponent to drop a held ball
            as a result of contact by a thrown live ball, stepping out of
            bounds.<br />
            • A live ball is a thrown ball that strikes or is caught by an
            opposing player without contacting the ground.<br />
            • A player may block a thrown ball with a ball being held, provided
            the holder does not lose control of the held ball as a result of the
            contact with the thrown ball.<br />
            • The held ball only needs to be knocked loose of the holder’s grip
            and does not need to strike the ground to cause the holder to be
            out.<br />
            • Even if the holder regains control of the held ball, he or she is
            still out<br />
            • A thrown ball that deflects off of another ball becomes dead and
            can no longer result in an out being scored against another player.
            For example, Player A blocks a thrown ball with his or her own ball.
            Player B then catches this ball. This does not result in an out, as
            the ball became dead after being blocked by another ball.<br />
            • Once a player is out, he or she must immediately drop any balls in
            hand and exit the playing area at the nearest boundary line.<br />
            • A player that is out must report to his or her team’s players’
            box. Each player in the players’ box must line up in the order that
            they were put out.<br />
            • One team may not control all of the balls for more than five
            seconds.

            Side-Line for opting Chasing or Defence respectively. No captain
            shall touch or pick up the coin. If any captain does so, Referee
            shall declare the captain of the other side as the winner of the
            spin of the coin. The captains of both sides shall wear a band on
            their sleeve.<br />
            3. Any 8 Chasers shall occupy the Chaser Block facing the Side-Line
            in such a way that no two adjacent Chasers facing the same Side
            Line. The ninth Chaser (Attacker) shall stand in either of the Free
            Zones to start the chase. Once Free Zone is opted by an Attacker to
            start the attack, then he should not be allowed to change the
            same.<br />
            4. After the commencement of a turn, no Chaser shall leave the
            Chaser Block without getting a KHO or changing the face. If he does
            so, it is a Foul, and repetition of the same will amount to
            misbehavior. The referee/umpire can compel the Chaser(s) to sit in a
            manner that was assumed at the commencement of the turn.<br />
            5. At the commencement of a turn, the first batch of three Defenders
            shall be inside the Field and remaining Runners shall occupy the
            seats meant for them. After a Defender is out, he shall occupy the

            6. An Attacker cannot cross the Central Lane between the Post Lines
            to go to the other half of the Court or to the Free Zone.<br />
            7. Foul shall not be declared if an Attacker while Chasing,
            touches/crosses that line of the Central Lane which lies on the side
            of his Chasing half. However, if an Attacker while touching or at
            the time of touching or as a result of action in putting out the
            Defender does so, Foul shall be declared and Defender shall not be
            declared out.<br />
            8. If a KHO is given, it shall be given from behind a Chaser by
            touching the Chaser by hand between an imaginary shoulder line and
            waistline and uttering the word, KHO with a sufficiently loud tone
            so that the Defender and officials can hear. Chaser shall not get up
            without getting a KHO.<br />
            • If the action of uttering the word KHO precedes the action of
            touching by hand, then it shall be deemed as Foul.<br />
            • The single action of touching will not be deemed as Foul. However,
            only uttering KHO and do not touch a Chaser by hand will be
            considered Foul. If an Attacker touches a Chaser sitting in the
            Chaser Block nearest to the Post, when Defender is near the Post,
            KHO must be given.<br />
            • If an Attacker utters any word other than the word 'KHO', it will
            be deemed as Foul. Uttering the word 'KHO&' or any word resembling
            'KHO' by any of the Chasers will also be treated as Foul.<br />
            9. The following three actions of an Attacker where a 'KHO' is given
            will be allowed. However, the feet of an Attacker shall not go
            beyond the Cross Lane.<br />
            • An attacker's front foot need not necessarily be in touch with
            Cross Lane.<br />
            • An Attacker may be in the Cross Lane.<br />
            • An Attacker's at least one foot should be in touch with the Cross
            Lane all the time, while the other portion of his body may go beyond
            that Cross Lane.<br />
            • After touching a Chaser except nearest to the Post (1 st &amp; 8th
            Chaser) if an Attacker moves away beyond the Cross Lane, he shall be
            deemed to have continued his attack and he shall not be allowed to
            utter 'KHO&' from the distance. However, if an Attacker moves along
            with the Cross Lane toward the Side-Line without committing any
            Foul, he may come back and give 'KHO'.<br />
            • An Attacker cannot rest or support a Chaser to put out a Defender.
            It will be deemed as Foul.<br />
            10. An Attacker shall not give a KHO to the extended arm, leg or any
            part of the body tilted towards him by a Chaser. Touching the back
            of the Chaser should not be insisted upon.<br />
            11. After giving a KHO, an Attacker shall cease to be so and shall
            sit down immediately on the Chaser Block of the Chaser to whom a KHO
            was given.<br />
            • After giving a KHO, it shall not be a Foul, if the Chaser while
            sitting loses the contact of the Cross Lane.<br />
            • The natural time needed to sit on the Chaser Block after giving a
            KHO must be given. However, this action should not obstruct the
            Defender and if obstructed, a Foul shall be declared.<br />
            • After receiving a KHO, an Attacker can touch a Defender before
            leaving the Chaser Block.<br />
            12. After getting a KHO, the Chaser will immediately be an Attacker
            and shall move towards the half that he is facing and shall go in
            the direction which he has taken by going beyond the Cross Lane of
            the Chaser Block or turning his Shoulder line towards any of the
            Posts. He cannot recede. As long as any part of the foot of an
            Attacker is touching the ground of a Cross Lane, he is not supposed
            to go beyond that Cross Lane.<br />
            • While moving on Cross Lane, if an Attacker at the time of the
            chase, slides/steps back, is not a Foul.

            1. Each team shall consist of no more than 7 taking to the field at
            any One time.<br />
            2. There are six officials looking after each Kabaddi match. The
            officials comprise a referee, a scorer, two assistant scorers, and
            two umpires.<br />
            3. The duration of the match is two halves of 10 minutes with a
            halftime break of 5 minutes.<br />
            4. At the start of a Kabaddi match, there is a coin toss with the
            winner having the choice as to whether to have the first raid or
            not.<br />
            5. In the second half of the match, the team that did not raid first
            shall begin the second half with a raid.<br />
            6. To win a point when raiding, the raider must take a breath and
            run into the opposition’s half and tag one or more members of the
            opposing team and then return to their own half of the pitch before
            inhaling again.<br />
            7. To prove that another breath hasn’t been taken, the rider must
            continue to repeatedly yell the word ‘Kabaddi’. Failure to do this,
            even for just a moment means that the raider must return to their
            own side of the court without points and the opposite team is
            awarded a point for a successful defensive play.<br />
            8. The team being raided is defending, and the players must prevent
            the raiders from tagging them and returning back over the halfway
            line. Whilst in defense, a team may score a point by successfully
            preventing the raider from returning to their own half after tagging
            them.<br />
            9. Raiders may only be grabbed by their limbs or torso, not by their
            hair, clothes, or anywhere else, and defenders are not permitted to
            cross the centerline.<br />
            10. Each team will take turns in raiding and defending. Following
            halftime, the two teams switch sides of the court, and the team who
            defended first in the first half begins the second half by raiding.

            1. The Table<br />
            The upper surface of the table, known as the playing surface, shall
            be rectangular, 2.74m long and 1.525m wide, and shall lie in a
            horizontal plane 76 cm above the floor. The playing surface shall
            not include the vertical sides of the tabletop.
            <br /><br />
            2. The Net Assembly<br />
            The net assembly shall consist of the net, its suspension, and the
            supporting posts, including the clamps attaching them to the table.
            The net shall be suspended by a cord attached at each end to an
            upright post 15.25cm high, the outside limits of the post being
            15.25cm outside the sideline.
            <br /><br />
            3. The Ball<br />
            The ball shall be spherical, with a diameter of 40mm. The ball shall
            weigh 2.7g. The ball shall be made of celluloid or similar plastics
            material and shall be white or orange, and matt.
            <br /><br />
            4. The Service<br />
            Service shall start with the ball resting freely on the open palm of
            the server's stationary free hand. The server shall then project the
            ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin, so that it
            rises at least 16cm after leaving the palm of the free hand and then
            falls without touching anything before being struck. As the ball is
            falling the server shall strike it so that it touches first his or
            her court and then, after passing over or around the net assembly,
            touches directly the receiver’s court; in doubles, the ball shall
            touch successively the right half court of server and receiver. From
            the start of service until it is struck, the ball shall be above the
            level of the playing surface and behind the server's end line, and
            it shall not be hidden from the receiver by the server or his or her
            doubles partner or by anything they wear or carry. As soon as the
            ball has been projected, the server’s free arm and hand shall be
            removed from the space between the ball and the net. The Order of
            Play In singles the server shall make the first service and the
            receiver shall make a return and thereafter alternately shall each
            make a return.
            <br /><br />
            5. In doubles, the server shall first make a service, the receiver
            shall then make a return, the partner of the server shall then make
            a return, the partner of the receiver shall then make a return and
            thereafter each player in turn in that sequence shall make a return.
            <br /><br />
            6. A Point Unless the rally is a let, a player shall score a point
            if an opponent fails to make a correct service; if an opponent fails
            to make a correct return; if, after he or she has made a service or
            a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly
            before being struck by an opponent; if the ball passes over his or
            her court or beyond his or her end line without touching his or her
            court, after being struck by an opponent; if an opponent obstructs
            the ball; if an opponent deliberately strikes the ball twice in
            succession.
            <br /><br />
            7. If an opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade
            whose surface does not comply with the requirements of 2.4.3, 2.4.4,
            and 2.4.5; if an opponent, or anything an opponent wears or carries,
            moves the playing surface; if an opponent, or anything an opponent
            wears or carries, touches the net assembly; if an opponent’s free
            hand touches the playing surface; if a doubles opponent strikes the
            ball out of the sequence established by the first server and first
            receiver; as provided under the expedite system (2.15.4). If both
            players or pairs are in a wheelchair due to a physical disability
            and his or her opponent does not maintain a minimum contact with the
            seat or cushion(s), with the back of the thigh, when the ball is
            struck; his or her opponent touches the table with either hand
            before striking the ball; his or her opponent’s footrest or foot
            touches the floor during play as provided under the order of play.

            <h4 style="color: black; margin-bottom: 2px !important">Rules:</h4>
            1. OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME:- Eight Ball is a call shot game played
            with a cue ball and fifteen object balls, numbered 1 through 15. One
            player must pocket balls of the
            <br /><br />
            2. Group numbered 1 through 7 (solid colors), while the other player
            has 9 through 15 (stripes). THE PLAYER POCKETING HIS GROUP FIRST AND
            THEN LEGALLY POCKETING THE 8-BALL WINS THE GAME.
            <br /><br />
            3. CALL SHOT:- In Call Shot, obvious balls and pockets do not have
            to be indicated. It is the opponent's right to ask which ball and
            pocket if he is unsure of the shot. Bank shots and combination shots
            are not considered obvious, and care should be taken in calling both
            the object ball and the intended pocket. When calling the shot, it
            is NEVER necessary to indicate details such as the number of
            cushions, banks, kisses, caroms, etc.<br />
            Any balls pocketed on a foul remain pocketed, regardless of whether
            they belong to the shooter or the opponent. The opening break is not
            a " called shot". Any player performing a break shot in 8-Ball may
            continue to shoot his next shot so long as he has legally pocketed
            any object ball on the break.
            <br /><br />
            4. RACKING THE BALLS:- The balls are racked in a triangle at the
            foot of the table with the 8-ball in the center of the triangle, the
            first ball of the rack on the foot spot, a stripe ball in one corner
            of the rack and a solid ball in the other corner.
            <br /><br />
            5. ALTERNATING BREAK:- Winner of the lag has the option to break.
            During individual competition, players will alternate breaking on
            each subsequent game.
            <br /><br />
            6. LEGAL BREAK SHOT:- To execute a legal break, the breaker (with
            the cue ball behind the head string) must either<br />
            (1) pocket a ball, or<br />
            (2) drive at least four numbered balls to the rail.<br />
            If he fails to make a legal break, it is foul, and the incoming
            player has the option of<br />
            (1) accepting the table in position and shooting, or<br />
            (2) having the balls reracked and having the option of shooting the
            opening break himself or allowing the offending player to rebreak.
            <br /><br />
            7. SCRATCH ON A LEGAL BREAK:- If a player scratches on a legal break
            shot, <br />
            (1) all balls pocketed remain pocketed (exception, the 8-ball: see
            rule 9)<br />
            (2) it is a foul<br />
            (3) the table is open.
            <br /><br />
            8. FOUL PENALTY:- The opposing player gets cue ball in hand. This
            means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table
            (does not have to be behind the head string except on opening
            break). This rule prevents a player from making intentional fouls
            which would put his opponent at a disadvantage. With the cue ball in
            their hands, the player may use his hand or any part of his cue
            (including the tip) to position the cue ball. When placing the cue
            ball in position, any forward stroke motion contacting the cue ball
            will be a foul, if not a legal shot.<br /><br />

            9. ILLEGALLY POCKETED BALLS:- An object ball is considered to be
            illegally pocketed when<br />
            (1) That object ball is pocketed on the same shot a foul is
            committed, or<br />
            (2) The called ball did not go in the designated pocket, or<br />
            (3) Safety is called prior to the shot. Illegally pocketed balls
            remain pocketed.
            <br /><br />
            10. SCORING:- A player is entitled to continue shooting until he
            fails to legally pocket a ball of his group. After a player has
            legally pocketed all of his group of balls, he shoots to pocket the
            8-ball
            <br /><br />
            11. OBJECT BALLS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE ON THE BREAK:- If a player
            jumps an object ball off the table on the break shot, it is foul,
            and the incoming player has the option of<br />
            (1) Accepting the table in position and shooting, or<br />
            (2) taking cue ball in hand behind the head string and shooting.
            <br /><br />
            12. OPEN TABLE:- The table is "open" when the choice of groups
            (stripes or solids) has not yet been determined. When the table is
            open, it is legal to hit a solid first to make a stripe or
            vice-versa. Note: The table is always open immediately after the
            break shot. When the table is open it is legal to hit any solid or
            stripe or the 8-ball first in the process of pocketing the called
            stripe or solid. However, when the table is open and the 8-ball is
            the first ball contacted, no stripe or solid may be scored in favor
            of the shooter. The shooter loses his turn; any balls pocketed
            remain pocketed, and the incoming player addresses the balls with
            the table still open. On an open table, all illegally pocketed balls
            remain pocketed.

            1. Pieces and how they move: In our club, once you move a piece and
            take your hand off it, you cannot change your move, unless your
            opponent lets you, which they do not need to do. However, you may
            touch a piece, consider a move, and put the piece back in its
            original position, as long as you don’t take your hand off of the
            piece during the process.
            <br /><br />
            2. Pawn (P): White pawns start on rank two, black pawns on rank 7.
            The first time a pawn is moved it can move forward either one or two
            ranks. It cannot jump over another piece. After it has moved once,
            whether it has moved up one or two, a pawn can only move one square
            forward at a time, and it cannot move backward. If a pawn advances
            to the end rank (8 for white, 1 for black) then it is promoted,
            which means it is exchanged for any other piece, with the exception
            of a king or another pawn. No pieces are moved from the chessboard
            itself; in this way, color can have two (or more!) queens at the
            same time. The pawn’s “value” is 1.
            <br /><br />
            3. Knight (N): Knights move in an L-shaped pattern. A knight moves
            one square over and two squares up, or two squares over and one
            square up, one square over and two squares back, etc. as long as the
            same shape and size of the jump is maintained. The knight is the
            only piece that can jump over other pieces; it jumps straight to a
            square without disturbing any of the pieces in between. Knights are
            generally brought out early, and this is good. The knight’s value is
            3.
            <br /><br />
            4. Bishop (B): The Bishop moves diagonally, any distance along a
            diagonal, without jumping over any pieces. A bishop that starts on a
            black square will always be on a black square, so it can only get to
            half the squares on the board. The bishop’s value is 3.
            <br /><br />
            5. Rook (R): The Rook moves in a straight line in any direction, as
            many spaces as it likes, without jumping. Rooks shouldn’t usually be
            used until later in the game, and should almost never be brought out
            at the beginning, because they will be harassed by pawns and other
            pieces, wasting time for the player who brought out the rook. This
            piece might also be lost by being brought out early, which is bad
            because the rook is valued at 5.
            <br /><br />
            6. Queen (Q): The Queen is the most powerful piece, as it can either
            move diagonally or in a straight line, which makes it like a bishop
            and rook put together. The queen cannot move like a knight. When the
            board is set up the queen always starts on her own color, so the
            white queen always starts on a white square. The queen is worth 9
            points because she can move to so many places on the board so
            quickly.
            <br /><br />
            7. King (K): The most important piece on the board is the King. The
            king can move one and only one space at a time, in any direction
            (left, right, forward, backward, and diagonally). The capture of the
            king is the object of the game. Capturing, checking, and the end of
            the game.
            <br /><br />
            8. Capturing: A piece captures an opponent’s piece by moving onto
            the square occupied by the opponent’s piece. That piece is removed
            from the board and replaced by the capturing piece. Knights,
            Bishops, Rooks, Queens, and Kings capture by moving in their normal
            way. The pawns capture differently, by moving one square diagonally,
            either to the right or left, onto the piece to capture. They cannot
            capture by moving straight forward. At no time may more than one
            piece stays in any square, and pieces cannot capture a piece of the
            same color.
            <br /><br />
            9. Check and Checkmate: When a piece would be able to capture the
            opposing king on the next turn, the king is said to be in check. The
            king in danger must get out of check on the next turn, either by
            moving out of the way, blocking the check with another piece or by
            capturing the attacking piece, whatever removes the threat. It is
            illegal to move your king into check, so, for instance, you can’t
            move your king next to the opponent’s king. The goal of the game is
            to put the opposing king in checkmate, which means he is in check
            and cannot be saved by any of the ways of escaping check. At this
            time the game is over, with the player whose king cannot escape
            check losing. The first player to get the opponent’s king wins; if
            white checkmates are black, black has lost, even if the black player
            could have checkmated white on the next move.
            <br /><br />
            10. If you see that you are going to lose, you can resign by
            knocking over your king, gently!. After checkmate or a resignation,
            shake hands across the board with your opponent and congratulate him
            or her on a good game.
            <br /><br />
            11. Draws: If a king is not in check, but no legal move can be
            played without putting the king in check, then the game is a
            stalemate, which is a tie, or draw. This usually happens when a
            player has only a king left and the other player, with many pieces
            left, creates a position in which the king cannot move but is not
            threatened. Another way to draw is if both players move 50 times in
            a row (a total of 100 moves) without capturing a piece or promoting
            a pawn.
            <br /><br />
            12. Players may also agree on a draw when they see it coming; to do
            this, extend your hand over the board, shake hands, and say, “I
            offer a draw.” If the opponent shakes your hand, it’s a draw. The
            opponent does not need to accept! They may think they can win. The
            last way to draw is through three-time repetition, where the same
            sequence of moves is repeated three times in a row. This means not
            only one player’s moves, but both players doing the same thing three
            times in a row.
            <br /><br />
            13. Special moves:<br />
            a) Castling: If both the king and a rook have not been moved yet
            during the game, there are no pieces between them, and the king is
            not in check, then the king and rook can move in a special way
            called castling: the king moves two spaces toward the rook, and the
            rook moves to the other side of the king, right next to the king.
            Often, this puts the king in a more protected position, behind some
            pawns. The king cannot castle out of, through, or into check. He
            cannot move through a square threatened by an enemy piece.<br />
            b) Capturing en passant: en passant is a special way a pawn can
            capture another pawn. It is French for “in passing,” which is
            helpful to know because the rule applies to a pawn that has just
            moved up two spaces, skipping over the square threatened by the
            opponent’s pawn. Here is an example: a black pawn is on b4. The
            white pawn on c2 has not moved yet. On white’s turn, the pawn on c2
            is moved to c4, evading capture by the pawn on b4. But the pawn on
            b4 has the option, for one turn only, of capturing the white c pawn.
            The black pawn moves to c3, and the white pawn is taken off the
            board. If black chooses not to capture immediately, then the chance
            is lost, and black may not capture en passant at a later time. En
            passant is always a one-turn chance for a pawn to capture a pawn
            that has evaded capture by moving up two spaces on its first turn.
            It does not apply to any other positions and only concerns pawns.

            The Rope<br />
            The game involves the usage of single equipment i.e. a rope. There
            is a red mark made in the middle of the rope. This red mark on the
            rope needs to be at a perpendicular angle to the exact center point
            on the ground, before the commencement of the game. A white mark is
            made exactly 13 feet from the red mark on either side of the rope.
            The game is won when either side with this white mark crosses the
            center point.
            <br /><br />
            Teams<br />
            According to the rules of tug of war, each team can accommodate a
            maximum of 8 members(for men and women both).
            <br /><br />
            Field and Marking<br />
            The game has to be played on a flat grassy patch of land. A line
            referred to as a centerline is marked on the playing zone and the
            rope is placed in a manner that its center mark should align the
            center marked on the ground. On either side of the rope at the
            distance of 13 feet from the centerline, 2 more marks need to be
            made. This is the point wherein the first member of each team will
            stand.
            <br /><br />
            How to Play<br />
            As mentioned earlier, the center of the rope should align with the
            center marked on the ground. As soon as the referee blows the
            whistle, each team can start pulling the rope into their territory.
            The objective of the game is for each team to pull the rope along
            with the members of the opposition team to their side.

            1. Five players will constitute a team. Teams may have no more than
            twelve players on the roster. A team must have a minimum of four
            players or a maximum of five players on the field at the start of
            the game.<br />
            2. Teams may not remove players from their roster once that player
            participates in a regular-season game.<br />
            3. Possession to start the game and sudden death will be determined
            by a coin toss. The team that wins the toss will have the choice of
            the kickoff or the side the team wishes to defend. The second half
            begins with an automatic reversal of the first choice of the
            options.<br />
            4. After a goal has been scored, the game is restarted in exactly
            the same manner with the kickoff being taken by a player of the team
            that did not score the goal. A goal cannot be scored directly from a
            kickoff.<br />
            5. The ball is out of play when it has completely crossed the
            sidelines or end lines whether on the ground or in the air.<br />
            6. The ball is kicked when it has gone outside.

            1. Sepak takraw (kick volleyball) is a competitive sport that
            involves 2 teams of 3 players, known as the left inside, right
            inside, and back. The game takes place at a court that’s about the
            same size as a badminton court, with a 1.5-meter-tall net. The
            grapefruit-sized balls are traditionally handwoven from bamboo or
            rattan, but modern ones are usually synthetic.<br />

            2. Basic rules and scoring for sepak takraw are similar to
            volleyball. Each team is allowed a maximum of 3 touches of the ball
            to pass it over the other side – without letting it touch the
            ground, of course. The first team to score either 15 or 21 points,
            depending on the rules in play, wins the set. The team that prevails
            in 2 sets wins the match.<br />

            3. The match starts when a teammate tosses the ball to the server
            while keeping one foot in a small ‘serving circle. He/she must kick
            the ball over the net with the other foot. After that, volleyball
            rules pretty much apply, except that the ball can’t be touched by
            the hands or arms. Top takraw players combine excellent foot-eye
            coordination with agility, anticipation, power, flexibility, and
            acrobatic skills.
            <br />
            4. Sepak takraw is known for the intricacy and speed of the methods
            used to send the ball aloft. Basic moves include the sole kick
            (using the arch or sole), instep kick, knee kick, shin kick,
            shoulder kick, and head kick. An advanced maneuver is a cross-legged
            jump kick – crossing your left leg over your right and leaping up to
            kick the ball with the instep of the left foot. Another is the
            cross-legged knee kick, where the player crosses his left leg over
            his right above the right knee, before leaping into the air and
            kicking the ball with his right knee.

            1. Two or four people can play. In singles, your opponent sits
            across from you in doubles, you play opposite your partner.<br />
            2. How to arrange the pieces on the board Line up the double whites
            to aim 'dead-on' into a corner pocket. Whoever plays first, or
            breaks is always white. The object of the game is to sink all of
            your pieces, using the heavier 'striker' in any of the pockets
            before your opponent.<br />
            3. Your turn continues as long as you keep sinking your pieces -
            luck shots count and all combinations are permitted.<br />
            4. When placing the striker on the board to shoot, the striker must
            touch both 'base lines' (see left diagram), either covering the red
            circle completely or not touching it at all.<br />
            5. The striker may not touch the diagonal arrow line.<br />
            6. Shooting styles are very personal - whichever 'grip' works for
            you are fine as long as you 'lick' the striker and don't push it.<br />
            7. Generally, it's best to orient your body in order to see the line
            of your aim while shooting comfortably; you may not move or leave
            your chair.<br />
            8. For forwarding shots, you can use your index finger, middle
            finger, or even the 'scissors' shot (right).

            <br /><br />

            <h4 style="color: black; margin-bottom: 2px !important">
              MISCELLANEOUS RULES:
            </h4>
            1. Sinking the striker costs you one piece and your turn. But, if
            you sink a piece in the same shot, then two come up and you shoot
            again.<br />
            2. After sinking the striker, your opponent places the due piece(s)
            within the center circle. If you haven't sunk one yet, you owe
            one.<br />
            3. If while shooting for the queen you also sink one of your pieces,
            the queen is automatically covered, no matter which went first.<br />
            4. If a piece jumps off the board, it is placed on the center spot.
            If pieces land on end or are overlapping, they are left that way.<br />
            5. If the center spot is partially covered when replacing the queen
            or a jumped piece, the piece should cover as much red as possible.
            If totally covered, the piece is placed opposite the next player
            behind the red spot.<br />
            6. If you sink your opponent's piece, you lose your turn. If you
            sink their last piece, you lose the board and three points.
